# AGOL-Meta-Snagger
This script will capture details about assets stored within ArcGIS Online along with usage data. Depending on configuration and the number of assets stored in AGOL, you may experience a long run time. In testing, ~1800 assets resulted in a first run of 24 hours, with follow-up updates of about 1 hour to refresh the data. These time frames were a result of pulling the full 2 years of data from AGOL as opposed to smaller chunks. 2 years of data for 1800 items resulted in ~1M rows in the metrics table.
